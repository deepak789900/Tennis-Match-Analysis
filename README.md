#Tennis Match Analysis using YOLOv8 🎾📊
Overview
This project leverages YOLOv8 for real-time tennis match analysis, tracking players and ball movement to extract key performance metrics. By using computer vision and deep learning, the system provides actionable insights for players, coaches, and analysts.

Features
✅ Real-time player and ball detection using YOLOv8
✅ Speed tracking of the ball and players
✅ Trajectory analysis for shot patterns
✅ Scalable for live matches and training
✅ Supports data-driven decision-making for performance improvement

System Architecture
The system follows a structured pipeline:

1️⃣ Input: Live video feed or pre-recorded footage
2️⃣ YOLOv8 Model: Object detection for players and ball
3️⃣ Tracking Module: Analyzes movement and speed
4️⃣ Data Processing: Computes performance metrics
5️⃣ Visualization & Output: Displays real-time statistics

Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/deepak789900/Tennis-Match-Analysis.git
cd Tennis-Match-Analysis
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download YOLOv8 Model
python
Copy
Edit
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # Download YOLOv8 pre-trained model
4. Run the Tennis Analysis System
To process a sample video, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
python tennis_analysis.py --input video.mp4
Usage
Upload a tennis match video or use a live camera feed.
The system detects players and ball movement in real time.
Key performance metrics such as speed, movement patterns, and shot intensity are displayed.
Coaches and players can use these insights to improve training and strategy.
Results & Accuracy
📌 Player detection accuracy: ~90%
📌 Ball tracking accuracy: ~50% (ongoing improvements)
📌 Real-time processing speed: 30 FPS (GPU recommended)

Future Improvements
🚀 Enhance ball tracking precision with improved dataset labeling
🚀 Integrate player pose estimation for biomechanical analysis
🚀 Develop a web dashboard for live data visualization
